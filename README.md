# shellfit
How to install: download both shellfit.py and shellfitfuncs.py (these two must be in the same folder), and put them in your PATH, then give shellfit.py x rights. 
Use as: shellfit.py file <options>
It does not have to be in the PATH - if it's not, use it as python3 path-to-shellfit/shellfit.py
